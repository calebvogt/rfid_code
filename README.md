## To Do list
- create actograms of individual and sex-based activity patterns. Actograms should come either from movements between zones (i.e. floor based antennas) or from wall/tube mounted RFID antennas, the idea being that actograms should capture movement between or through spaces, not capturing rest at a particular space.
